# GithubIssue

For a better experience, the App should run on an iPhone X and the project built by lastest Xcode ( 11.0 )

Architecture For the architecture, I chose MVVM, DI and Coordinator.

GitFlow The repository follows GitFlow Guidlines: branches come from master, are merged in develop and finally develop is merged into master.

Third party libraries

I have chosen three well-known libraries that prove useful for the matter of this challenge as well as any other production App. In fact, I have used myself these frameworks in Production environment.

Apollo: 

SDWebImage: This library provides an async image downloader with cache support. I love this library, it is easy to use and simplify the caching process.

SnapKit: SnapKit is a DSL to make Auto Layout easy on both iOS and OS X. Actually, I'm not a big fan of Storyboard, because it come to many problems when work with the large team, whenever someone at the team work with same storyboard, it always end up with a lots of conflict and to fixed those conflicts, it's really a challenge. So I decided to SnapKit.

Reusable: When I decided to use programmatically layout by code, Reusable help us to reusing views easily and in a type-safe way.

Language: Swift 5

Version control: GitHub
